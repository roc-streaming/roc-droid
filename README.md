## Features

Roc Droid is based on [Roc Toolkit](https://github.com/roc-streaming/roc-toolkit) streaming engine, which notable features are:

* real-time streaming with guaranteed latency;
* robust work on unreliable networks like Wi-Fi, due to use of Forward Erasure Correction codes;
* CD-quality audio;
* multiple profiles for different CPU and latency requirements;
* relying on open, standard protocols, like RTP and FECFRAME;
* interoperability with both Roc and third-party software.

Compatible senders and receivers include:

* [cross-platform command-line tools](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/tools/command_line_tools.html)
* [modules for sound servers](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/tools/sound_server_modules.html) (PulseAudio, PipeWire, macOS CoreAudio)
* [C library](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/api.html) and [bindings for other languages](https://roc-streaming.org/toolkit/docs/api/bindings.html)
